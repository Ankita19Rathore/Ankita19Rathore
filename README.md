## 💫 About Me

I'm a focused and disciplined Information Technology student with a strong interest in WordPress development, backend systems, and problem solving. I enjoy understanding how applications work internally and building clean, practical solutions for real world use cases.

I have worked on academic and personal projects such as digital health record systems, token management platforms for healthcare, and decentralized image storage applications. These experiences have helped me understand backend workflows, databases, and the importance of structured and maintainable code.

I believe in consistent effort, learning by doing, and strengthening fundamentals step by step. Currently, I am improving my WordPress and backend skills, documenting projects clearly on GitHub, and building a strong foundation in Data Structures and Algorithms to become industry ready.

Outside of coding, I enjoy simplifying technical concepts, helping peers, and growing through continuous learning.
