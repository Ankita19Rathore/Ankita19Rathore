## 💫 About Me

I am an Information Technology student with a strong interest in WordPress development and backend systems. I enjoy understanding how applications work internally and building clean, practical solutions for real-world problems.

I have worked on academic and personal projects such as digital health record systems, healthcare token management platforms, and decentralized image storage applications. These projects helped me build a solid understanding of backend workflows, databases, and maintainable code practices.

Currently, I am strengthening my WordPress and backend skills, contributing to open-source projects, and building strong fundamentals in Data Structures and Algorithms to become industry-ready. I enjoy simplifying technical concepts and learning through consistent, hands-on practice.
