💫 About Me:

I'm a dedicated and curious technology enthusiast with a strong interest in software development, particularly in backend systems, web technologies, and problem-solving through Data Structures and Algorithms. I enjoy working at the core of applications, where logic, structure, and clean implementation come together to solve real-world problems.

Throughout my academic journey, I’ve explored multiple domains including web development, backend logic, and blockchain-based systems. I’ve worked on projects such as digital health record platforms, token management systems for healthcare organizations, and decentralized image storage applications, which have helped me understand system workflows, data handling, and scalable design concepts. I believe in building projects that have practical value rather than focusing only on theoretical learning.

Whether it’s consistently practicing DSA (even when it feels challenging), improving my GitHub by documenting projects properly, or strengthening my fundamentals in Python, C++, and JavaScript, I focus on steady and honest growth. Currently, I’m working towards becoming industry-ready by improving code quality, project structure, and problem-solving skills.

Outside of development, I enjoy simplifying complex technical concepts, helping peers, and continuously pushing myself to grow more confident and disciplined. I’m always open to learning, collaboration, feedback, and new challenges.
